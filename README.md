# Etch-A-Sketch

This project is a browser-based version of a sketchpad and Etch-A-Sketch. It allows users to draw on a grid of square divs, change the color of the divs on hover, and reset the grid size using a button.

## Project Overview

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive sketchpad. Users can draw on the grid by hovering over the square divs, and there's an option to reset the grid size with a user-defined number of squares per side.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the webpage, including the grid container and reset button.
- `styles.css`: Provides styling for the grid, squares, and button using CSS, with a focus on flexbox for layout.
- `script.js`: Implements the dynamic grid creation, hover effects, and reset functionality using JavaScript.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open index.html in your web browser.
3. Interact with the sketchpad by hovering over the grid squares and use the "Reset Grid" button to change the grid size.

 ## Extra Credit Features

Randomized RGB Value: Each interaction with a square randomizes its RGB color.
